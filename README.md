# project-one-concentration
I have decided to do the game concentration. My theme will be (...not sure yet).

1.Overview and General Instructions:
    ⋅⋅⋅The game Concentration will involve 16 cards (laid out in a row of 4 x 4). There will overall be 8 different cards (as 8*2=16). You will have 12 tries to pick correctly and win. You will lose if it takes more than 12 times to pair the 16 cards together. 
    ⋅⋅⋅The board will have 16 cards set in a row 4 by 4 with a header <Concentration>. Next to the header on the top right side, there will be a "recorded tries" placement that will record the amount of tries you have had, out of 12. eg. "tries : 1/12". If you have reached 12 and still have not won, the game will need to be able to register that you have lost. 
    ⋅⋅⋅Under that there will be a placement for the amount of cards matched-out of 8. If 8 cards have been matched, under 12 tries than the game will need to register that you have won the game. 
    ⋅⋅⋅Depending on how complex I plan to make this. I might have it so that the game recognises the total games that have been played and the overall total score. Every game won=1 point, so after 10 games won, total score=10. The total games would equal overall games played. so if you played 10 games but only won 8, this would be total score=8, games played=10.
    ⋅⋅⋅Under the header, there will be the 16 cards. Under this there will be a <reset> button. (An image of the layout will be included).
